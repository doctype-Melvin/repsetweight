This is the second version of my [Workout Logging App](https://flexflow.vercel.app/) (mobile only) built with [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Status

Currently moving through NextJS 13 docs and learning about new and exciting features.
Will deploy a live version of my second iteration of this app as soon as possible.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
